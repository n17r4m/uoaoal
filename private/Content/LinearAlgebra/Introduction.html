	The subject of linear algebra is concerned with linear processes, 
	relationships or phenomena. 
	Let us consider some examples to see what this means:
</p>

<ul class="ui very relaxed list">

	<li>
		<p>
			Suppose you are travelling at constant speed of 80km/h. 
			After one hour you will have covered a distance of 80km. 
			After 2 hours you will have covered a distance of 160km; 
			after 3 hours a distance of 240km, etc. 
			Thus time travelled and distance covered are in a linear relationship:
		</p>
		<div class="ui compact segment">
			distance travelled in k hours = k⋅(distance travelled in 1 hour)
		</div>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			Suppose each day you put a marble into some bag.
			Then you know that after 1 day you will have 1 marble, 
			after 2 days you will have two marbles; 
			after 3 days you will have 3 marbles in the bag, etc. 
			This is an example of a linear relationship:
		</p>
		<div class="ui compact segment">
			marbles after k days = k⋅(marbles after 1 day)
		</div>
	</li> 

	<li>
		<p>
			When driving a car, lets make a table which records the distance 
			it takes to brake the vehicle to a full stop from a given speed. 
			Such a table reveals a quadratic relationship between speed 
			and brake distance to a full stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			In a cell growth experiment you might encounter a table like the following
		</p>
		<table class="ui unstackable definition table">
			<tr><th>Day</th>
				<td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><th>Cell Mass</th>
				<td>1m</td><td>2m</td><td>4m</td><td>8m</td><td>16m</td><td>32m</td><td>64m</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			This corresponds to a substance which doubles itself every day. 
			Thus number of days passed and cell mass are not in a linear relationship 
			but rather in an exponential relationship:
		</p>
		<div class="ui compact segment">
			cell mass on day k = 2k−1⋅ (cell mass on day 1)
		</div>
	</li>

</ul>


<p>
	Such examples demonstrate how easy it is to comprehend linear relationships 
	and to work with them. In contrast, non-linear relationships can be 
	counter-intuitive and much harder to work with. 
	For an example of the counter intuitive nature of non linear relationships 
	I'll offer you a deal:
</p>

<p>
	I give you $100 today, if over the next 14 days you agree to give 
	me 1 penny today, 2 pennies tomorrow, and on each day double the 
	number of pennies of the day before.
</p>
<div class="ui styled accordion">
	<div class="title">
		<i class="dropdown icon"></i>
		Does this sound like a good deal to you?
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<h3>Double the Pennies</h3>

		<p>
			So, what was this deal again? 
			Your prof offers you $100 today if you agree to pay 1 penny today, 
			2 pennies tomorrow, 4 pennies the following day, etc. 
			for the next 14 days.
		</p>

		<p>
			On the surface this sounds like a great deal: 
			collect $100 while only having to pay a few pennies back for 
			each of the next 14 days. But before committing to such a deal, 
			perhaps it is better to work out carefully what actually happens here.
		</p>

		<table class="ui definition table">
			<tr><th>day</th>
				<td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><th>pennies</th>
				<td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>16</td><td>32</td><td>64</td><td>128</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<table class="ui definition table">
			<tr><th>day</th>
				<td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><th>pennies</th>
				<td>256</td><td>512</td><td>1024</td><td>2048</td><td>4096</td><td>8192</td><td>16384</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			Oooopss! Those numbers of pennies start out small. 
			But they sure grow rapidly! So you see that, on the 14-th day alone, 
			you'd pay your prof back everything (s)he gave you, 
			plus you'd be handing over an additional $63.84.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is an example of exponential growth, a gotcha in many ways:
		</p>

		<div class="ui compact segment">
			number of pennies paid on day k = 2k
		</div>

		<p>
			For another impression of exponential growth, 
			work out what happens if you let the penny doubling 
			return scheme run for 21 days instead of for 14.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Beware of debt: interest is compounded, and this leads to exponential 
			growth of debt if no payments are being made. 
			The same kind of gotcha as the example above. 
		</p>
	</div>

	So far for a first encounter with linear vs. nonlinear. 
	In this introductory ebook on Linear Algebra we will encounter
</p>

<ul class="ui relaxed list">
	<li>Vector spaces: the environment within which linear processes can be described</li>
	<li>Systems of linear equations, and methods for solving them</li>
	<li>Matrices as a vast extension of the system of real numbers ℝ</li>
	<li>Linear transformations and their relationship to matrices</li>
	<li>Determinants and their relationship to oriented volume</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here we study the subject of linear algebra in its own right. 
	However, you might also be interested in knowing that it enables 
	us to examine and describe non-linear processes and phenomena as well: 
	the idea underlying differential calculus is to approximate non-linear
	processes by linear ones. The power of calculus then stems from mechanisms
	which carry properties of the linear approximations to properties of the
	approximated process itself.
