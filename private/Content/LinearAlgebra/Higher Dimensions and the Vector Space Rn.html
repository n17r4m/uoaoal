	In this chapter we will introduce our work environment: for each integer n≥0 a
	straight and endless space, denoted ℝⁿ. The integer n is the dimension the
	space. A point in ℝⁿ is given by n numbers x₁,…,xₙ, written in order as
	(x₁,…,xₙ). We will study in detail how to use such points to describe objects
	like lines and planes in ℝⁿ. We will learn how to move such objects around and
	how to change their shape. We will learn general rules on how to compute with
	such points.

	Let us take an intuitive look at the <strong>dimension concept</strong> For a
	natural number n, a space is called n-dimensional if, at each of its points,
	it permits exactly n independent directions of motion which can be combined to
	reach any nearby point. For example,
</p>

<ul class="ui unordered list">
	<li>
		A single point is a 0-dimensional space, as it permits no motion inside of
		it at all.
	</li>
	<li>
		A line or a curve are 1-dimensional spaces: inside of it, at each of its
		points, there is exactly one direction of motion. It could be called
		forward-backward.
	</li>
	<li>
		A plane or a surface are 2-dimensional spaces: inside of it, at each of its
		points, there are exactly two independent directions of motion. These could
		be called forward-backward and left-right. Every other direction of motion
		can be combined from these two.
	</li>
	<li>
		The space surrounding us is 3-dimensional: inside of it, at each of its
		points, there are exactly three independent directions of motion. These
		could be called forward-backward, left-right, and up-down. Every other
		direction of motion can be combined from these three.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In popular literature some mystery surrounds the concept of 4-dimensional and
	even higher dimensional spaces. Let us say for now: such spaces exist. Once we
	learn how to identify them, we find them all around us, and we use them all the
	time. So why are they mysterious? They are pushed into mystery because they are
	not accessible to our visual sense!

<h4>Chapter overview</h4>

<p>
	Let us now outline the essence of this introductory chapter to the vector
	space ℝⁿ.
</p>

<ol type="ui ordered list">
	<li>
		We begin by introducing the concept of n-tuple of numbers. The collection of
		all n-tuples is the space ℝⁿ. We then use the product operation on sets to
		see that ℝᵐ×ℝⁿ=ℝᵐ+n.
	</li>
	<li>
		We introduce a notion of distance between two points P and Q in ℝⁿ. It is
		based on the Theorem of Pythagoras.
	</li>
	<li>
		To be able to make a transition from one point P to another Q, we introduce
		the arrow PQ⟶. It has the point P at its tail and the point Q at its tip.
		The length of PQ⟶ is the distance between P and Q.
	</li>
	<li>
		An arrow is determined by its tail point, its direction, and its length. A
		vector consists of all arrows of given direction and length. It is sometimes
		convenient to think of a vector as an arrow that is allowed to float freely
		while not changing its length nor its direction. We may describe a vector
		using a coordinate n-tuple. Thus a coordinate n-tuple now serves two
		purposes: (a) locate a point and, (b) describe a vector. We explain how
		these two purposes are related.
	</li>
	<li>
		Next we explain how two vectors can be added, and how a vector is multiplied
		by a number. These operations extend the rules for adding and multiplying
		numbers to vectors.
	</li>
	<li>
		A vector is determined by its direction and its length. By virtue of these
		properties vectors lend themselves to modeling any real life quantity that
		is determined by its direction and its magnitude. Here are some examples:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Shifting (translating) an object from one place to another (without
				rotating it in the process) moves each point of the object in the same
				direction by the same distance. Therefore, we may use a vector to
				describe this translation.
			</li>
			<li>
				A force is determined by the direction in which it acts and its
				magnitude. Therefore, we may use a vector to represent this force. The
				velocity of a moving object is given by the direction of the motion and
				its speed. Therefore, we may use a vector to represent this velocity.
			</li>
			<li>
				As an application, we offer an introduction to linear motions, that is a
				point shaped particle moving along a line with constant speed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
