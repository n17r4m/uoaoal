Using:

	Starting up for the first time, there won't be much to see as the database
	will not have any courses in it. Simply 'sign in' using the button at the
	top right and register for an account. (no verification required, yet)
	
	Then, you will be able to create a new course, and subsequently, new course
	content. By default, course content will be created in the 'unpublished'
	state, so to make it visible when looking at the course from the home page
	you need to click the publish button (red button = unpublished, turns to
	green when it has been marked as published) for the course content items.
